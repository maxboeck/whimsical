## Submit a Site

To add your website or another one you think should be featured to this list, [open an issue](https://github.com/maxboeck/whimsical/issues/new?template=add-this-website.md&title=Add+this+Website%21) in this repository. Include the website URL and (optionally) the author's twitter handle. Also, please describe why you think this website should be on the list.

That reason could be a fun feature, a cool effect or a clever bit of copy - check out the existing sites to get the feeling. The most important thing is that it's personal, quirky and fun. It's a curated list, so I'll check each one personally and if it's cool, I'll add it.

## About

I made this project after reading ["In Defense of a Fussy Website"](https://css-tricks.com/in-defense-of-a-fussy-website/) by Sarah Drasner. It is meant to showcase how a more personal web could look like, and hopefully give you some inspiration to make your own corner of the web a bit weirder.
